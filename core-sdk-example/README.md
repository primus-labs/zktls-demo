# core sdk example
The Primus core sdk demo. You can run it with the following command.

## Run

```bash
npm install
node index.js
```

## Configuration

Before starting the attestation, you need to configure the following parameters:

### App ID and App Secret
The **App ID** and **App Secret** can be obtained from:
- [Primus Developer Hub - My Projects](https://dev.primuslabs.xyz/myDevelopment/myProjects)
- Create a new project or use an existing one to get your App ID and App Secret

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in this directory and set `APP_ID` and `APP_SECRET` to your values. The `.env` file is listed in `.gitignore` and will not be committed—do not commit it to the repository.
